      <h2> What is A Bed Every Night?</h2>
      <p>A Bed Every Night is a commitment to provide a bed, welcome, hot meal and support for anyone sleeping rough in
        Greater Manchester. The extra provision will operate from 1st November 2018 until 31st March 2019 and will be
        available throughout this period, regardless of the temperature.</p>
      <p>The programme will make every effort to address the needs of those rough sleeping, offering additional
        temporary accommodation with lower criteria than current provision; removing them from the risk of extreme
        weather, improving health and wellbeing.</p>
      <p>A Bed Every Night is not a sticking plaster but the first stage of a new systematic approach across Greater Manchester to end homelessness. Ideally, we want to move people through emergency shelter into the right accommodation and support option for them, to enable them to stay off the streets.</p>
      <p>The staff in the provision will work pro-actively with individuals, referring agencies, accommodation
        providers and other services to try to find suitable move-on options or reconnection.</p>

      <h2>How do people get inside?</h2>
      <p>There will be two main routes into the winter provision:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Street outreach teams will go out to people rough sleeping and support them to get into the provision</li>
        <li>People will also be able to use the usual routes through their town hall, housing advice teams
          and out of hours numbers. To view this information, please select a borough below:</li>
      </ol>

      <h2>Why might there still be people sleeping rough?</h2>
      <p>This is a complicated challenge and it won't be perfect right from the start. We will learn and adapt as we
        go, incorporating new people and new ideas. It will be evaluated by the people coming in to these spaces and
        judged by who we still meet outside.</p>
      <p>Not every environment suits everybody, we will learn about individual needs as we get to know individual
        people. This gives us the time to work with people and gives people the time to have a stable start for
        creating a life that makes sense to them.</p>
      <p>The people we work with have had varied experiences with the system, not always positive - it takes time,
        compassion and imagination to rebuild trust in these circumstances. This is where YOU can help - please donate
        <a href="/greater-manchester/donate-needed-items/">items</a>, <a href="/greater-manchester/volunteer/">time</a>,
        or <a href="https://bedeverynight.co.uk/">money</a> to make A Bed Every Night possible.</p>

      <h2>What is different about this approach in GM?</h2>
      <p>We want to provide more than a bed, this provision is an opportunity to form a relationship, to understand the
        person and have a stable start to making a life that makes sense to them around a safe place to stay. We want
        to build a supportive, therapeutic relationship for a time of personal crisis that people can be referred in
        to.</p>
      <p>The innovation in this project is the whole region working together; the public sector, voluntary sector,
        grassroots groups, businesses and citizens, together. For this project, local connection will be GM wide, with
        individuals reconnected to their local authority the following day where possible.</p>
      <p>While we won't turn people away, this scheme is only available to people whose last address was in Greater
        Manchester. We simply do not have the resources to open it up to people from further afield.</p>

      <p>Succeeding in this mission will be a challenge, but one that we must rise to; working together, learning as we
        go along, and continually adapting how this works based on what people experiencing homelessness and frontline
        workers tell us. If you have questions, concerns or suggestions, please get in touch at <a href="mailto:aben@streetsupport.net">aben@streetsupport.net</a>.</p>
