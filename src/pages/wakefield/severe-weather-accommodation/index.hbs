      <p>Wakefield Baptist Church provides a night shelter as part of the severe cold weather provision funded by Wakefield District Council.Â <strong>The shelter officially is open when the Met Office Weather Forecast predicts three nights where the temperatures will be 0 degrees C or below. However where possible it will aim to open on any night that the temperature is 0 degree centigrade or below.</strong></p>
      <p>The shelter provides overnight accommodation (and more) to homeless people in the Wakefield District and when open is available from 8pm to 8am.</p>
      <p>A decision to open the shelter is based on one check of the weather forecast usually between 6-8am each morning. Please do not assume the shelter is open form your own checks and if unsure make contact with the Night Shelter Coordinator on <a href="tel:01924382966">01924 382966</a> or e-mail <a href="mailto:contact@nightshelter.org.uk">contact@nightshelter.org.uk</a>.</p>
